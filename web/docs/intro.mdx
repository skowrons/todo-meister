# Todo Meister

"Todo Meister" is a tool that can seamlessly integrate into any CI/CD pipeline.
Its goal is to extract defined todo comments such as `TODO:`, `FIXME:`, etc.
Correspondingly identified tokens are then transferred to the choosen ticket system and can be viewed in the normal development process.

## Way TODO comments

The topic of whether or not TODO comments belong in code is a widely debated issue.
There are those who argue, among other things, that the flow of their code would be disrupted if they constantly have to switch to different tools.
On the other hand, there are those who believe that it's easy to lose track of TODOs when they are embedded within the code.
Moreover, such annotations may be overlooked over time and not followed up on.
Some tools, like SonarQube, even go so far as to say that TODO comments represent a form of code smell.

Regardless of whether TODOs, REFACTOR, or FIX-ME comments/issues are ignored in the code or in a ticketing system, Todo Meister aims to strike a balance by mirroring all relevant comments into a ticketing system.

Consequently, this tool is not the appropriate venue for conducting such a debate.
We use this tool internally within our projects and ensure the satisfaction of both camps by doing so.
